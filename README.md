# NordVPN GUI for Linux

## Overview

The NordVPN GUI for Linux is a user-friendly graphical interface built on top of the NordVPN command-line interface (CLI). This project aims to simplify the usage of NordVPN on Linux systems by providing an intuitive graphical interface, enabling users to easily connect to NordVPN servers, manage their connections, and access advanced features.

The NordVPN CLI is a powerful tool that allows users to control their VPN connections through the command line. However, for users who prefer a visual interface or are less familiar with the command line, this GUI provides a convenient alternative.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** The NordVPN GUI offers a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application.
- **Server Selection:** Users can browse and select from a vast list of NordVPN servers across various locations, empowering them to choose the most suitable server for their needs.
- **Connection Management:** The GUI enables users to effortlessly establish, disconnect, and manage their NordVPN connections with just a few clicks.
- **Connection Status:** Users can view real-time information about their current connection, including the server location, IP address, connection duration, and data usage.
- **TODO: Advanced Settings:** The GUI provides access to advanced settings offered by the NordVPN CLI, such as enabling or disabling the kill switch, managing custom DNS settings, and configuring auto-connect options.
- **TODO: Favorites and Recent Servers:** Users can conveniently bookmark their favorite servers and quickly access recently used servers for enhanced usability.
